## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Who estimates tasks, and how do we know the estimation is fair?**

Most of our tasks are 30-60 minutes in size and this estimate
is set by the project manager. The estimate is not negotiable
(see [&sect;5](/policy.html#5)). However, very often, more time is
required to complete a task. In this case, we encourage you to use
[Puzzle Driven Development](http://www.yegor256.com/2009/03/04/pdd.html).

**How do you use oDesk/Upwork/Elance?**

We often work through oDesk, but we don't use their time tracking
system at all. We are using them only as a payment processor, to
distribute payments. You should **not** report your time there. We
send payments ourselves once you complete a task. Remember,
we don't pay for time, but only for results (see [&sect;5](/policy.html#5)).
