## Lifecycle

Each project developed by us goes through four phases,
which are explained [here](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/06/software-project-lifecycle.html).
This article is supposed to demonstrate all technical
aspects of this process.

### Request

You can reach us by phone, email or just visit us in
California, but the best way is to fill a short online
form [here](http://www.teamed.io). When you click "submit",
you will be forwarded to [Netbout](http://www.netbout.com),
a platform where we communicate with programmers and clients.

You will have to create an account in Netbout, using your
Facebook, Google+ or Github account, and choose a unique user name.
It's a quick process, should take less than a minute.

### Discussion

Two people are invited to the discussion in Netbout right after
we receive your request &mdash; our CTO and VP/BizDev.
They will ask you about your project, to make sure we understand
the scope, at least preliminarly. They may also ask you to share
the documentation you have about the project.

We're ready to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement
([NDA](http://www.yegor256.com/2015/05/04/how-to-protect-business-idea.html)) at this stage.

We'll be ready to answer your questions and explain how we work. If
necessary, we can make a presentation, a video call, or even a meeting.
We have to make sure we're on the same page and really can help you.

### Estimate (if necessary)

If you're interested in a preliminary [ROM estimate](http://www.technoparkcorp.com/process/cost/rom/),
a few architects will be invited to the discussion and will estimate
your scope.

### Contract &amp; Deposit

When everything is clear and you're ready to start, we sign a contract.
We send you a draft of the contract, you make corrections if necessary
and then we send a final version for electronic signature, via
[Adobe eSign](https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/documents/esignatures.html).

When the contract is signed, you will send a deposit to us, to
cover initial project expenses and secure our partnership.

### Management Crew

We will add our key management personell to the discussion in Netbout, including
project manager, HR manager, and CFO.

Your project will have a dedicated project manager.

Then, the HR manager selects two system analysts for your project and two
software architects. Their names will be announced to you and we'll discuss
their profiles with you. If there will be any objections, we'll change them.

You can also invite more people from your in-house team to Netbout,
to help you monitor the progress.

### Management Reports

The project manager will publish a few management reports to the discussion
in Netbout. They will demonstrate the state of scope, budget, schedule,
risks, and quality in the project.

Reports will be updated by the project manager a few times a day during
the course of entire project.

### GitHub

We manage all our projects in [GitHub](http://www.github.com). We will
ask you, and all your technical people, to create accounts there (unless
you have them already). Then, the project manager will create a new repository and will
give you access to it.

### "Thinking" Phase

One system analyst will get in touch with you, to perform
[requirements elicitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_elicitation)
and create the first version of README GitHub document.

Usually, the system analyst will talk to you and your team via Skype, Slack, phone,
or any other means suitable for you. His or her goal is to properly understand
you and create the first version of README, as soon as possible.

This phase usually takes up to two weeks and up to 20 hours.

### "Building" Phase

When the README document is ready, a software architect will create a skeleton
of the product, to prove that the solution works.

This phase usually takes up to two weeks and up to 80 hours.

### "Fixing" Phase

When skeleton is ready, HR manager will invite programmers to the project
and their names and profiles will be announced to you, in Netbout.

The project manager will start assigning tasks to programmers in GitHub.

We are using our proprietary software and open source tools to automate
the process of software engineering. The majority of routine management
activities go through our proprietary **management platform** and are
automated. We're also using these open source and commercial instruments:
[rultor.com](http://www.rultor.com) for merging, deploying and releasing;
[travis-ci.com](http://www.travis-ci.com) and [appveyor.com](http://www.appveyor.com) for continuous integration;
[pdd](https://github.com/teamed/pdd) for automation of sub-tasking;
[est](https://github.com/teamed/est) for estimation;
[hoc](https://github.com/teamed/hoc) for hits-of-code calculation;
[coveralls.io](http://www.coveralls.io) for test coverage tracking.

We encourage you to take active participation in GitHub discussions
and provide your feedback about quality and scope.

All financial questions must be discussed in Netbout, where our CFO
and VP/BizDev are present during the course of the entire project.

### "Using" Phase

When the product is ready for the market, we continue to support it.
Most programmers will be removed from the team, since their help
is not required any more. We will keep a few people in stand-by mode
for as long as necessary for your business needs.
