You need more technical and management resources. You need many of them and very soon. You can go for head-hunting or you can try outsourcing. However, if you are savvy enough, there is a better way: Team as a Service®.</p></p></div></div><div class="paragraph"><div class="left"> <img src="http://img.teamed.io/image4.png"></div><div class="right"><h1>Go Distributed</h1><p><p>We give you a distributed team of highly qualified programmers. All of them work remotely from their home countries. We give them tasks and control their outputs. We stay responsible for the end result and milestones.</p></p></div></div><div class="paragraph"><div class="left"> <img src="http://img.teamed.io/image3.png"></div><div class="right"><h1>Outstanding Quality</h1><p><p>Due to our unique management model, we can deliver much higher quality than many other software teams. First, our rules are very strict: unit tests first, mandatory static analysis, pre-flight builds and continuous delivery. Second, we pay only for deliverables that pass our quality checks. This combination gives outstanding results.</p></p></div></div><div class="paragraph"><div class="left"> <img src="http://img.teamed.io/image7.png"></div><div class="right"><h1>Targeted Skills</h1><p><p>Since we don't have programmers on payroll, we have a luxury of choosing people from the market, specifically required for your project. If it needs to be written in Scala, we won't try to sell you in-house Python developers, just to cover our expenses. Unlike most software teams, programmers are not a burden for us.</p></p></div></div> </article></section> <footer class="normal"><ul><li> <i class="fa fa-twitter"></i>  <a href="">teamedio</a><br/> <i class="fa fa-envelope"></i>  <a href="mailto:sales@teamed.io">sales@teamed.io</a><br/> <i class="fa fa-phone"></i>  860.506.5536<br/></li><li> <img src="xdsd.png"> <img src="tpc.png" height="70px"></li><li> <a href="">angel.co/teamed-io</a><br/> <a href="">crunchbase.com/teamed-io</a></li></ul> </footer> <script>var _gaq=_gaq||[];_gaq.push(["_setAccount","UA-1963507-34"]),_gaq.push(["_trackPageview"]),function(){var t=document.createElement("script");t.type="text/javascript",t.async=!0,t.src=("https:"==document.location.protocol?"https://ssl":"http://www")+".google-analytics.com/ga.js";var e=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];e.parentNode.insertBefore(t,e)}()</script></body></html>
